# TRUEDIP: TRUsted decentralized Eldercare DurIng a Pandemic

Taking care of the elderly population is of crucial significance during a pandemic due to (1) higher mortality rate and (2) longer times for which they are affected by lockdown; that is, they may have the most restricted movement. Caregivers need to help seniors not only in household tasks but also buying groceries, shop for supplies or transport them to another place. All this must be done by people that, with a high likelihood, are negative for the virus. The proposed TRUEDIP system is expected to help via a mobile APP and a webpage to find the best match between certified caregivers and seniors. The proposed solution – and our main innovation – is to build such a platform based on the blockchain technology, for increased security and privacy.
